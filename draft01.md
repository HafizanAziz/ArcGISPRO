Steps to Create the POC
Identify Key Functions:

Determine the specific functions that will be most beneficial for your replanting field blueprint process.
For example, a rotation function could be used to adjust the orientation of planting grids.
Set Up Development Environment:

Ensure you have ArcGIS Pro installed and set up.
Install necessary Python libraries and ArcPy.
Develop the Sample Program:

Write a Python script that integrates with ArcGIS Pro.
Implement a few key functions, such as:
Rotation Function: Rotate spatial features by a specified angle.
Data Import/Export: Import sample data and export modified blueprints.
Visualization: Display the replanting fields and any modifications.
Test the Sample Program:

Run the script with sample data to ensure it performs the desired functions correctly.
Make any necessary adjustments based on test results.
Documentation:

Document the script and its functions.
Prepare a brief report on how the script can be used and its benefits.
Example: Rotation Function Script
Here's a simple example of a Python script that performs a rotation on spatial features using ArcPy: code.py

Next Steps
Discussion and Refinement:

Discuss the specific functions you want to include in the POC.
Refine the requirements based on your needs.
NDA and Sample Data:

Establish the NDA to protect your data and models.
Share the sample data and existing model script once the NDA is in place.
Development and Testing:

Develop the POC based on the refined requirements.
Test the POC with your sample data.
Review and Feedback:

Review the POC results with your team.
Provide feedback and discuss the next steps.
